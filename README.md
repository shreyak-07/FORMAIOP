# ✦ FORMA AI

## Turn Complex Forms Into Simple Conversations.

Forma AI is an AI-augmented dynamic form engine that turns natural-language descriptions into safe, structured, reviewable form data. The application combines schema-driven MongoDB forms, React Hook Form, conditional logic, AI extraction with LangChain/OpenAI, authentication, save/resume drafts, and submission history.

> **Important:** This repository extends the original Week 1/Week 2 implementation. The existing insurance-claim schema, dynamic rendering, `showIf` conditional logic, React Hook Form validation, Magic Input, LangChain extraction, and backend schema validation are preserved and integrated into the SaaS experience.

## Features

- AI Magic Input: natural language → structured form values
- Schema-controlled AI extraction; unknown LLM fields are rejected server-side
- MongoDB/Mongoose dynamic form schemas
- 18-question insurance claim template
- Schema-driven conditional `showIf` logic
- React Hook Form validation and multi-step workflows
- AI extraction review with editable AI-populated fields
- Save Draft, debounced auto-save, resume and delete draft
- Final review before submission
- Submission history and detail pages
- JWT authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- Password reset token flow
- Form builder for text, textarea, number, email, date, select, radio and checkbox fields
- Responsive SaaS dashboard, navigation, empty/loading/error states and toast feedback
- Versioned form schemas so submissions retain their form version

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- MongoDB locally or MongoDB Atlas
- OpenAI-compatible LLM API key for AI extraction

## Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` from `backend/.env.example`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/forma_ai
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
NODE_ENV=development
```

Never put `LLM_API_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, or MongoDB credentials in the frontend or Git.

## Install and Run

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

The API runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### Frontend

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite application runs on `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` to the backend.

## Database Seed

The seed preserves the original `insurance-claim` form and its 18 fields. The schema now also has presentation sections for the production multi-step UI. Running the seed replaces the existing insurance-claim schema with the maintained canonical version.

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

## Authentication

Private API resources require a JWT in:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Create account |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Sign in |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Current user |
| PUT | `/api/auth/me` | Update profile |
| POST | `/api/auth/change-password` | Change password |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Logout acknowledgement |
| POST | `/api/auth/forgot-password` | Create reset token |
| POST | `/api/auth/reset-password` | Reset password |

For local development, reset tokens are printed by the backend. A production deployment should connect this flow to an email provider rather than exposing tokens through logs.

## Forms API

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/forms` | List accessible forms |
| GET | `/api/forms/:formId` | Get schema |
| POST | `/api/forms` | Create user-owned form |
| PUT | `/api/forms/:formId` | Version and update form |
| DELETE | `/api/forms/:formId` | Delete owned form |

System forms such as the seeded insurance claim have `createdBy: null` and are available to authenticated users as shared templates. User-created forms are ownership-scoped.

## AI API

```http
POST /api/ai/extract
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

```json
{
  "formId": "insurance-claim",
  "text": "I hit a deer on I-95 yesterday in my Honda Civic. The windshield shattered and nobody was injured."
}
```

The backend loads the selected schema, tells the LLM only about allowed fields, parses the response defensively, validates types/options, and removes unknown fields before returning data to the browser.

AI failure never prevents manual completion.

## Submission API

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/submissions` | Create draft |
| GET | `/api/submissions` | List current user's submissions |
| GET | `/api/submissions/:id` | Get own submission |
| PUT | `/api/submissions/:id` | Update draft |
| DELETE | `/api/submissions/:id` | Delete draft |
| POST | `/api/submissions/:id/submit` | Validate and submit draft |

Submission records contain `userId`, `formId`, `formVersion`, `values`, `aiAssistedFields`, `status`, `currentStep`, timestamps and `submittedAt`.

## Frontend Routes

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- JWT secrets and LLM credentials are environment variables.
- Private form/submission APIs require authentication.
- User-owned resources are authorization checked on the backend.
- AI output is treated as untrusted input.
- Unknown AI fields are discarded.
- Server validation runs before final submission.
- API errors avoid stack traces and sensitive implementation details.
- Authentication endpoints are rate limited.
- CORS is restricted to configured origins.

## Deployment

### Frontend

The frontend is suitable for Vercel or Netlify. Configure the deployment so `/api` reaches the production backend, or replace the Vite proxy with the production API base URL.

### Backend

The backend can be deployed to Render or Railway. Set all environment variables in the platform's secret/environment configuration.

### MongoDB

MongoDB Atlas is recommended for production. Use a restricted database user and network access policy rather than committing connection credentials.

## Validation and Testing

Backend unit tests are under `backend/src/tests` and can be run with:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

Frontend production build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Manual acceptance checklist:

- Signup/signin/logout
- Protected routes
- Insurance claim loads from MongoDB
- AI extraction populates matching fields
- Unknown AI fields are rejected
- AI failure leaves manual form usable
- Conditional injury/other-vehicle fields appear correctly
- Multi-step validation blocks invalid progression
- Draft save and auto-save work
- Draft resumes at saved step
- Final review is editable
- Submitted data appears in history
- Submission detail shows AI-assisted fields
- Form builder creates and edits schemas
- Desktop/tablet/mobile layouts remain usable

## Product Positioning

### Traditional form

```text
50+ questions → manual entry → static branching → long completion time
```
